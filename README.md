Finding SOU:s on regeringen.se is time consuming and annoying. The script
scrapes the webpage for all SOU:s. Lots of false positives, but better than
searching manually.

This repo does not contain the code, just the sou:s.

Initially written to get statistics on different sou:s.

The reason to do this is are mostly that regeringen.se
    * forbids direct linking to SOU:s
    * does not provide TLS
    * breaks links all of the time
